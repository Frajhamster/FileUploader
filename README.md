# FileUploader
File Uploader is a node.js server, that uses your disk space as a storage, for uploading and downloading files.


### Safety
File Uploader is not completely safe, but you can use it as a base, and improve it for your own needs.


### Port-Forwarding
You will need to select a port and do the port-forwarding for it. You will also need to change the public IP variable in node.js server file to your own IP.


### Connecting to the file uploader
You and your friends (And also other people) can then use the application, by simply connecting to the following URL in the webbrowser:

publicIp:port

Example with random ip and port:

208.227.195.170:4320
